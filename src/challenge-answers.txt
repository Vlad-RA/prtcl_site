Login Stage (Stage 0):
Username: admin
Password: Sup3rS3cr3tP@$$

Steps to solve:
1. Open the browser's developer tools (e.g., right-click on the page and select "Inspect" or press F12).
2. Examine the HTML source code of the login page.
3. Look for HTML comments, which look like <!-- This is a comment -->.
4. The username 'admin' and the password 'Sup3rS3cr3tP@$$' can be found inside one of these comments.
5. Upon successful login, a flag will be displayed in a notification. The content of the flag (e.g., flag{W3lc0me_to_th3_Syst3m}) is configured in the application's environment.

Secret Data Stage (Stage 1):
Access Key: OpenSesame123

Steps to solve:
1. After successfully logging in, you will land on a page asking for an "access key".
2. Open the browser's developer tools and inspect the JavaScript code associated with this page, particularly the validation logic for the input field.
3. You will find an explicit comparison being made, for example: `if (userInput.trim().toLowerCase() === "OpenSesame123".toLowerCase())`.
4. This reveals the required access key: 'OpenSesame123'.
5. Upon submitting the correct access key, a flag will be displayed in a notification. The content of the flag (e.g., flag{S3cr3t_Data_Unl0ck3d}) is configured in the application's environment.
